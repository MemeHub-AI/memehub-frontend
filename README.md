## Introduction

Memehub is an innovative Memecoin launcher that allows users to launch a Memecoin with almost zero cost at the click of a button.

There is no need to add liquidity, as the price discovery is facilitated through a bonding curve.

Smart contracts are used to ensure the security of the Memecoin.

Once a certain market cap is reached, liquidity is added via smart contracts, and the LP tokens are sent to a black hole.

Additionally, AI is used to mine global news trends and localized hot topics, providing project initiators with the best Memecoin ideas.
